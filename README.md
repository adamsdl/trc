# Transform-roughness correlation approach

Repository for data and code used in plots for paper submitted to ESurfD.

## Contents

Files consist of the code and data used in "Short communication: Multiscalar drag decomposition in fluvial systems using a transform-roughness correlation (TRC) approach" submitted to Earth Surface Dynamics (Copernicus), 2020. 

The data comprise the thalweg elevation profiles for Experiment 1a (elev.txt), flow resistance data for each experiment (summary.txt files), data for the sensitivity analysis (sensitivity.txt), R script for perfoming the TRC analysis (trc_code.R), and R script for making the plots featured in the manuscript (trc_plot.R).

## Prerequisites

This code requires R to be installed, and requires additional packages that are not a part of base R.
